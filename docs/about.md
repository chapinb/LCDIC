# About LCDIC

This tool was created to allow the scripted collection of devices from a mounted hard drive. This drive can be any OS 
that is not currently running from the machine. If the device is the current OS, the active registry hives are not 
available as they are in use and cannot be accessed by Python. In addition, any open files will not be accessible.
